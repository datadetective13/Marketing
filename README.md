 1. Alist of key performance indicators (KPIs) that are relevant for tracking user interactions
 and engagement.
 2. Adescription of the data tracking tools or platforms you would use for data collection.
 3. Adata tracking implementation plan, including code snippets or pseudocode for tracking
 specific events or user actions.
 4. Adata schema or structure for storing the collected data.
 Task 2: Data Analysis
 You have collected data from the tracking plan in Task 1. Now, you need to perform some basic
 data analysis. Given a dataset in CSV format, please complete the following tasks:
 1. Import the dataset into a data analysis tool or programming language of your choice
 (e.g., Python, R, Excel).
 2. Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and outliers if present.
 3. Calculate basic statistics and visualizations (e.g., histograms, and scatter plots) for key
 KPIs.
 4. Identify any trends, anomalies, or insights in the data and provide a brief analysis.
 Task 3: Data Reporting
 Based on your analysis in Task 2, create a data report that includes:
 1. Anexecutive summary of the key findings and insights from the data analysis.
 2. Visual representations of the data (charts, graphs, tables).
 3. Recommendations for actions or improvements based on the data.
